# box-bots-hackathon
This contains the source code for our helper robot, "Snackatron" made for the box bots hackathon, a hackathon where the main material is cardboard.

The code uses an ESP32 and was developed on the platformIO extension on VSCode, seperated into header and main files
- The `/include` folder contains external files containing helper functions

The actual code that runs the robot can be found in  `/src` utilizing the Arduino framework, libraries, and the ESP32 libraries
